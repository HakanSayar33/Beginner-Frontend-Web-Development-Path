# To Do List 
This to-do list is made with only Css and javascript. Patika is the 3rd javascript assignment of the Beginner Frontend Web Development Path course.
## Bootstrap classes used
- If the task is left blank, we can give an error message with Bootstrap Toast.
- When we press the button, we add the li element to the list. We used javascript DOM technology while doing this task.
